## STM32F769 Discovery

This repository will be store the notes of mine about STM32F769 Discovery Kit Application. I am going to share my whole used documents with it. As well as the video source that I found useful for situations. I am going to use __Arduino UNO Clone__ in case of slave board needed. But, that's not an arduino class, so I am not going to explain the arduino part in the codes. I also have oscilloscope under my hand, so if I need I will use it. But I don't think it's necessarry to have one.

<hr>

My plan to take note about topics:

- [ ] GPIO (Led Example)
- [ ] PWM
- [ ] UART / USART
- [ ] DMA Application
- [ ] USB
- [ ] I2C
- [ ] SPI
- [ ] SD Card
- [ ] Ethernet Applications

I have seperate for [Screen Application With Touch GFX](https://github.com/serkankas/Touch_GFX_Tutorial), that's why I don't plan to apply that course in here.

You can find useful documents and links in here as well. __NOTE THAT NONE OF THE LINKS ARE AFFILIATE, just to give you an idea what I've been working with.__
